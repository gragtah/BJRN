Modern dating, end-to-end (BJRN)

Tinder interface for finding a date - manual 
swiping (automate later?). Once you get a match on Tinder, automated 
conversation with the person using NLP. Move towards setting up date by 
suggesting times and places using your google calendar for free times 
and Yelp API for place suggestions (personal preferences + date’s). Try 
to get phone number of date, Twilio API to send SMS from there on.
Once date is set up, set up delayed API call to book Uber 
when date is coming up in the hour.

Prototype features (hackathon):

Tinder matching → Conversation →  Suggest places using Yelp →
 Google calendar reserve

Technologies, tentatively:
Amazon SQS Message Timers, EC2, EBS, SNS, MongoDB, NodeJS, 
UberAPI, YelpAPI, GoogleAPI, FacebookAPI, oauth, TinderAPI, TwilioAPI
